        ### Nutriscore

        We want to evaluate whether the **tags provided by users** are truly correlated 
        with the **nutritional values** of the recipes.

        The **Nutriscore**, used in several European countries, provides a quick and simple way 
        to assess the nutritional quality of a product based on data such as **calories, proteins, sugar, fat, salt**, etc.  
        üëâ [Reference](https://docs.becpg.fr/fr/utilization/score5C.html)

        - Each nutrient receives a **score**.  
        - Some are considered **positive** (proteins, fiber).  
        - Others are considered **negative** (calories, fat, salt).  
        - The **final Nutriscore** is calculated as:  
        `Nutriscore = Positive Score ‚Äì Negative Score`.

        The goal is to explore **what relationships** can be extracted between the Nutriscore and 
        other variables (user tags, nutritional values).

    First, we can observe the different Nutri-Score values and their correlations with each other.

        We should only see orange "health tag" bars in **categories A and B**.

        While the proportion is lower in D, there are actually **more health tags in category E than there are recipes in category E**.

        This discrepancy could be explained by:
        - Incorrectly entered values,
        - The fact that **foods and drinks** use different Nutri-Score calculations,
        - Or the inability to verify whether the data is standardized (e.g., per 100g).
